## Azure Cosmos DB

I work heavily in Azure Cosmos DB. I work on maintaining a set of packages that aid working with Cosmos DB in C#. The .NET SDKs cover basic CRUD operations, paging, querying and change feed processing. There is also a package which makes event sourcing easy when using Cosmos DB as an event store. See some of these below
